      "     In the early morning light, the wide Alderaani forests were\n",
      "tipped with gold. Danah Antilles, Dowager Princess of Alderaan,\n",
      "surveyed the dappled pelt of gilt leaves and shadow from high\n",
      "above. She sat at her breakfast table as if enthroned. Although\n",
      "she was nearly ninety, her back was sapling-straight, and her\n",
      "eyes were as clear as the jewels clasped around her throat.\n",
      "Another strand of gems shone above them, wound into her silver\n",
      "hair. On the other side of the prismed tower chamber, her son\n",
      "nodded to the servant droids, dismissing them.\n",
      "     Danah turned away from the view, waiting for the soft drone\n",
      "of the elevator shaft to diminish and fall silent. \"Well,\" she\n",
      "said at last, \"What is the news from the Senate?\"\n",
      "     \"Bothersome,\" Bail Organa said. His pale blue robes flowed\n",
      "behind him as he walked back to his own chair. Sitting down, he\n",
      "took a sip of tisane. \"Nearly half now support Palpatine's\n",
      "proposal, and many of the rest are whispering secession. I don't\n",
      "know which party alarms me more.\"\n",
      "     \"Unfortunately, Palpatine is right. If we do not present a\n",
      "unified defense, we may soon have nothing to defend. Alderaan was\n",
      "much like that before you were born. If external arbitration had\n",
      "not intervened, the noble houses would have torn one another\n",
      "apart long ago. Imagine what would have happened if invaders had\n",
      "come from outside, as the Republic now faces.\" She shook out her\n",
      "napkin with a sharp snapping sound and laid it across her lap.\n",
      "     \"You were hardly innocent of the vendettas, Mother.\"\n",
      "     \"I never said I was.\" A predator's smile leapt across her\n",
      "features, vanishing as she bent to examine the fruit. \"But I knew\n",
      "when to halt and make peace, unlike Helice. She never did accept\n",
      "my alliance with your father; she went to her death accusing me\n",
      "of having betrayed our house. A pity, really. She and her\n",
      "daughter might have been useful to us.\" Selecting a piece, she\n",
      "began to open it with a small silver knife.\n",
      "     \"Yes, well, at present, we have more pressing concerns. Have\n",
      "you been able to gauge the mood here at court? How do the people\n",
      "stand on the war?\"\n",
      "     \"Which party would they prefer to be in, do you mean? Our\n",
      "people have an easier decision than most; since we have no longer\n",
      "have armed forces nor legal weapons, they need not fear death,\n",
      "only taxes. Without the fear of conscription, they seem willing\n",
      "enough to forward funds to the front, if it proves necessary.\"\n",
      "She watched Bail bite into another spiced bun. \"So, shall you\n",
      "declare a necessity?\"\n",
      "     \"As little as I like to, we may have no choice. The Nechti\n",
      "have retaken Gefras and are advancing toward the Ikatya system.\"\n",
      "     \"Truly?\" With careful motions, she put her fruit rind and\n",
      "her knife down on her plate. \"I think this might be an opportune\n",
      "time for me to inquire about Castra's health.\"\n",
      "     \"Castra? What has my wife to do with--\" Setting down his\n",
      "half-eaten bun, he wiped his hands on his napkin. \"No, she is not\n",
      "pregnant yet. We've only been married a year, you know. Isn't one\n",
      "of Liane's children at Academy in this sector?\"\n",
      "     \"He graduated into the sector fleet this year. His\n",
      "contingent is being forwarded to Ikatya to appease the Senate. I\n",
      "had understood the combat front had drawn back from there. I\n",
      "thought he might enjoy seeing his sister again, but perhaps now I\n",
      "should recall one of them.\" Her voice was devoid of enthusiasm.\n",
      "     \"Only one?\"\n",
      "     \"Very well; both if you insist. I would just as rather leave\n",
      "them there, but if you haven't a direct heir yet, they're all we\n",
      "have. Unless, of course, you wish Alderaan to dissolve into civic\n",
      "feuding again. I doubt the Senate will have the patience to spare\n",
      "us more arbitrators so soon.\n",
      "     \"It is a pity about those two, really.\" Danah chose a small\n",
      "pastry and daubed it with yeast-spread as she spoke. \"I do hope\n",
      "you and Castra will provide an heir soon so I can put Liane's\n",
      "children out of the way.\"\n",
      "     \"I do hope you're joking.\" Bail paused cautiously. \"The\n",
      "vendettas are over, Mother. Assassination as a preventive measure\n",
      "is no longer considered good domestic policy.\"\n",
      "     \"Scarcely domestic. They're five sectors away.\" She poured\n",
      "more tisane into Bail's empty cup, then into her own. Before he\n",
      "could retort again, she said, \"I take it you have forgotten\n",
      "Liane's manuevering, then.\"\n",
      "     \"She paid the price for her treason. I see no reason why her\n",
      "children should be forced to as well.\"\n",
      "     \"Your father said the same of Liane, as Helice's daughter.\n",
      "She killed him.\"\n",
      "     Bail leaned back in his chair and gazed out through the\n",
      "glass-paned walls, his cup of tisane in hand. On the sunward\n",
      "side, the panes were automatically darkening in a latticed\n",
      "arabesque, screening out daylight as it intensified. Without\n",
      "looking at his mother, he said, \"I know you've been monitoring\n",

      "open. The white luminescence of the corridor tarnished to dark\n",
      "gold, reflected from the hair and robes of the man who stepped\n",
      "forward. Senator Palpatine took a sip from the jewelled goblet in\n",
      "his hand. \"Good evening, Lady Arcadia. Would you care to join me\n",
      "for dinner?\"\n",
      "     Backed against the wall, the second guard gasped out, \"My\n",
      "lord, this woman has infiltrated the palace somehow, and--\"\n",
      "     \"In fact,\" Palpatine continued, \"I was expecting you\n",
      "somewhat earlier. This excellent Fentaraj vintage has been\n",
      "warming for a half-hour now. Do come in before its bouquet\n",
      "deteriorates further.\"\n",
      "     \"But my lord!\"\n",

      "relieve you from your posts for the night. You are dismissed.\"\n",
      "     The guards limped away, one half-dragging the other. Before\n",
      "they had gone two meters, Palpatine drew a blaster from his\n",
      "sleeve and shot them both. The blade of Arcadia's lightsaber\n",
      "flashed up like indigo dawn. \"What do you want from me?\"\n",
      "     The Senator graciously extended his blaster, grip first.\n",
      "\"Your company at table, of course. Once you have obliged me with\n",
      "that, we may discuss other matters. For example, your reasons for\n",
      "coming to Coruscant in this way, or at all.\" She hesitantly took\n",
      "the blaster from him, shoving it into her belt with a stare of\n",
      "disbelief.\n",
      "     A momentary shudder of indecision rippled through Arcadia.\n",
      "Her blade flickered and went out as she dropped out of defensive\n",
      "stance. \"I never wanted to set foot on Coruscant again. But you\n",
      "refused every petition I sent, and you made it impossible for me\n",
      "to seek justice in your courts. This was the only way left.\"\n",
      "     \"Yes, I intended it so. But come now, you must be hungry\n",
      "after your jaunt through my security perimeter.\" He stepped back\n",
      "into his chambers, obliging Arcadia to follow him. The bodies of\n",

      "the iridescent tiles, her dusty grey fatigues out of place in the\n",
      "rich surroundings. He motioned toward a chair so intricately\n",
      "worked that it seemed made of silver lace. \"If I'd wanted you\n",

      "     Although she could sense a concealment of truths in his\n",

      "dim light. The tension made the complex sauces and gels taste\n",
      "like ashes.\n",
      "     When she could no longer bear the silence, she asked,\n",

      "Espaliered branches pressed against the walls, vainly reaching\n",
      "toward the glass dome high above. Palpatine chose a path enclosed\n",
      "by thick-foliaged trees, their branches interwoven and grafted\n",
      "together overhead. The darkness would have been near-absolute\n",
      "without the small utility lamp clipped to Arcadia's belt. \"I\n",

      "him a great deal of authority against me. As I understand\n",
      "Alderaani politics, the title is hereditary, and is granted for\n",
      "life. Other than his infant daughter, you are his nearest kin,\n",
      "and therefore his next heir.\"\n",

      "     Vader's reach was greater than hers, she saw. Ordinarily,\n",
      "she would have had an advantage in speed and agility over this\n",

      "aside more slowly than she should have, and the blood-hued saber\n",
      "bit into the carpets centimeters from her moving feet.\n",
      "     She evaluated her adversary as they fought. Like herself,\n",

      "was. \n",
      "     Dodging behind a tall stone screen, she drew him behind it\n",
      "then leapt over to the other side to wait for his return around\n",
      "the edge. The crackle of vaporizing amethyst warned her to wheel\n",
      "about as Vader slashed through the screen and advanced through\n",
      "the severed halves. She was still able to strike his thigh,\n",
      "leaving a dull melted smear on the surface of his cuisse, but he\n",
      "moved away before she could reach the weakened spot again.\n",
      "     He inclined his head. \"First blood,\" he said, and thrust at\n",

      "     By implicit pact, they both avoided the lethal targets of\n",
      "head and torso. But the narrow beams of energy could cripple as\n",
      "well as kill; a blow from Vader skittered down Arcadia's\n",
      "reflective vambrace and fell aside, removing a thin shaving of\n",
      "plasteel. It would have taken her arm off at the elbow had she\n",
      "been unprotected. She parried his next blow, and the next,\n",
      "turning her damaged side away each time, then drove him back\n",
      "until he stumbled on a fragment of the felled stone screen. He\n",
      "fell heavily, jarred enough to lose his hold on his saber. The\n",
      "blade hissed and winked out as the handle rolled away.\n",
      "     Palpatine stretched out his hand, to which Vader's\n",
      "deactivated lightsaber obligingly flew. Arcadia lowered her own\n",

      "bargain, my lord?\"\n",

      "quickly as possible.\"\n",
      "     Vader, who had been regaining his footing, froze in place.\n",

      "     \"Why, yes,\" Palpatine said brightly. \"Did I neglect to tell\n",
      "you before?\" He tossed the lightsaber back to Vader.\n",
      "     Vader straightened and stood up with savage abruptness. He\n",

      "slowly toward her. \"I would yield to an equal, but I will enjoy\n",
      "your death, Alderaani bitch!\" His blade ignited and slammed down\n",
      "at her as he charged.\n",

      "reflections from Vader's glinted on her armored wrists, just\n",
      "before her eyes, as she blocked the vicious swing at her head. He\n",
      "forced the blade down at her until she could feel her gauntlets\n",
      "scrape against the mask of her helmet.\n",
      "     Stunned by the suddenness and strength of his attack, she\n",
      "dropped to the floor and rolled aside. Scrambling upright, she \n",
      "ducked under another swing and struck his side. The blow cut away\n",
      "a great swath of his cloak, but did little damage to his body.\n",
      "     He snarled and kicked out at her shoulder. Arcadia cried out\n",
      "as the blow connected, flinging her back, but somehow retained\n",
      "her balance. Out of his reach, she struggled for air and\n",
      "composure. _He's in a killing rage_, she thought. _He'll\n",
      "overreact to any moves I make, if he notices them at all. All or\n",
      "nothing_.\n",
      "     A few feints confirmed her conjecture. She led him forward\n",
      "into the glass-domed courtyard, then leaped into the shadowed\n",
      "colonnade. As he followed her, the iolite gleam of her lightsaber\n",
      "vanished. Enraged, Vader ran ahead into the darkness.\n",
      "     Just around the bend, Arcadia slipped out of the colonnade\n",
      "between two trees and looped back, reentering behind him. Vader\n",
      "had slowed, looking before him in the dim red illumination from\n",
      "his blade, when she leaped up at his back, catching one arm\n",
      "around his neck and dragging him down. The light for which he had\n",
      "been hunting now flashed up across his vision.\n",
      "     \"I have no wish to kill you. Will you yield?\"\n",

      "     She tossed her saber to her free hand, catching it before he\n",
      "could call it to himself. But she was unable to parry at full\n",
      "strength; his slash tore partway into her neck armor before she\n",
      "could stop it. Her flesh was barely touched, but she could hear\n",
      "the vapor seals giving way. He flung her back, and she fell onto\n",
      "the paving, saber handle flying.\n",
      "     The loosened helmet tilted up, obstructing her vision. She\n",
      "threw it off to see Vader's blade poised over her heart. Her own\n",
      "saber was in his other hand. She closed her eyes, waiting for the\n",
      "searing blow.\n",
      "     It did not come. When she opened her eyes again, Vader was\n",
      "still standing over her. His voice sounded as if his breath had\n",

      "     That diminutive, coming from that black skull-mask, struck\n",
